# GitHub Survivor

GitHub Survivor is a simple bug dashboard that shows an overview of bugs in a
GitHub-hosted repo. We use it at [99designs][1] to keep an eye on the bug count
and remind ourselves to close bugs.

## Overview

It's easy to forget about bugs when you're knee-deep in feature development.
This dashboard is a good way to keep bugs on people's minds, and to show
at-a-glance information about the current bug situation.

GitHub Survivor scrapes your bug data using the [GitHub API][2] and stores it in
a Mongo database for quick querying. It shows, at a glance:

 * Top/bottom bug closers for the current reporting period (default: our 2-week-long sprint)
 * Current open bug count
 * Net difference in open bugs since the last reporting period
 * Charts (yay!)
    * Number of bugs opened/closed for the last 12 reporting periods
    * Number of open bugs over the last 12 reporting periods

There are bug trackers that provide this kind of data, but we wanted something
fun that integrates with our existing bug tracking solution. (GitHub issues are
pretty rudimentary, but they integrate nicely with pull requests, commits, etc.)

## Setup

Requirements:

* Python >= 2.7
